# fauna-data
A json file of animals and their features

Feel free to add more animals.
Feel free to use this JSON for your projects.



This was first created to be used by this simple guessing game: https://alaminos.github.io/animal-guess-prototype/

# adding animals
the rule is that there should be 3 snippets of information about that animal, 
dato1 being the most general one (example: "mammal"), and dato3 the giveaway (example: "it meows").
